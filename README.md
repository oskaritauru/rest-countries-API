## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- React
- RESTful API

### What I learned

- Using APIs: I learned how to work with RESTful APIs in a React application to fetch and manipulate data, including retrieving, processing, and displaying information in components.
- JavaScript and JSX Skills: I enhanced my JavaScript skills, particularly in using JSX syntax, which combines HTML and JavaScript, and in managing state and props in React.
- Component-Based Architecture: I built reusable components, which is a core concept in React, allowing for better code organization and maintainability.
- State Management: I gained experience in managing component state and understanding how to lift state up when necessary, as well as using hooks like useState and useEffect.
- Styling in React: I explored different ways to style my components, including CSS modules, styled-components, or traditional CSS, and successfully implemented theme switching.
- Error Handling: I learned how to handle errors during API calls and provide clear error messages to users, as well as manage loading states.
- Version Control: I used Git for project management, which helped me understand the basics of version control and collaboration with other developers.
- Responsive Design: I improved my skills in creating responsive layouts that work well on various screen sizes, using CSS.
